# MegBot
Facebook messenger groups have the ability to reach 100+ unread messages pretty quickly. At that point, you have to make a decision: miss out on the messages and risk missing an awesome discussion, or read every single line and risk oportunity cost. Now you don't have to make that decision! MegBot allows you to automate your Facebook message group summaries.

## Details
MegBot itself is an object that allows you to interface with Facebook messenger through your own account. The example attached summarizes the past 50 messages the group said. It does this either every 50 messages, or when someone in the chat group calls it with "@megbot".
